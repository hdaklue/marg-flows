# Video Resize Functionality Test Guide

## Implementation Complete ✅

The resizable video block functionality has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### Files Created/Modified:

1. **ResizableTune.js** - New block tune class for resize functionality
2. **video-resize.css** - Styling for resize handles and interactions
3. **video-upload.js** - Modified to integrate with ResizableTune
4. **video-upload-data.json** - Example data structure with resize fields

### Features Implemented:

✅ **Resizable Block Tune**
- Toggle resize mode via tune button in EditorJS toolbar
- Visual resize handles around video when active
- Corner and edge handles for different resize operations

✅ **Drag to Resize**
- Mouse drag functionality on resize handles
- Aspect ratio locking (with toggle option)
- Visual feedback during resize operations

✅ **Dimension Storage**
- Custom dimensions saved to block data
- Dimensions restored when block is rendered
- Integration with existing video data structure

✅ **Responsive Design**
- Mobile-optimized handle sizes
- Larger touch targets on smaller screens
- Responsive constraints based on container size

✅ **Visual Polish**
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Visual indicators for resize mode
- Hover effects on resize handles
- Dark mode support

## How to Test:

1. **Upload a video** using the VideoUpload plugin
2. **Click the resize tune button** in the block settings (corner arrows icon)
3. **Drag the handles** around the video to resize it
4. **Toggle aspect ratio lock** by modifying maintainAspectRatio in tune
5. **Save and reload** to verify dimensions persist

## Revert Points:

If you need to revert these changes:

1. **Delete new files:**
   ```bash
   rm resources/js/components/editorjs/plugins/ResizableTune.js
   rm resources/css/components/editorjs/video-resize.css
   rm resources/js/components/editorjs/plugins/video-upload-data.json
   rm resources/js/components/editorjs/plugins/resize-test.md
   ```

2. **Restore original video-upload.js:**
   ```bash
   mv resources/js/components/editorjs/plugins/video-upload.js.backup resources/js/components/editorjs/plugins/video-upload.js
   ```

## Technical Notes:

- **ResizableTune** follows EditorJS tune patterns and integrates seamlessly
- **Resize data** is stored in `data.resize` object within block data
- **CSS handles** use absolute positioning with proper z-indexing
- **Event handling** prevents conflicts with other EditorJS interactions
- **Memory management** includes proper cleanup of event listeners

## Known Limitations:

- Resize handles only appear when tune is actively enabled
- Maximum width is constrained by parent container
- Touch devices require larger handle targets (implemented in CSS)
- Video modal uses original dimensions, thumbnail uses custom size

## Future Enhancements:

- Double-click to reset to original size
- Preset size options in tune menu
- Keyboard shortcuts for resize operations
- Copy/paste resize settings between blocks
